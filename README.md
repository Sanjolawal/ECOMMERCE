## Ladieswear Ecommerce Web App

## What it is
This was a personal full stack project. App was built using React primarily for the frontend, Express for the backed, and utilised stripe APIâ€™s (for making and receiving payment by users and owner respectively). I enjoyed the lessons learnt and fun experienced during the app development.

# Brief
* Full-Stack application.
* Uses an Express API to serve data from a Mongo database.
* Consumes API with a separate front-end built with React.
* Has multiple relationships and CRUD functionality.
* Has Stripe integration for payment.
* Deployed on render, for users usage.

# Blocker

The only issue was deployment to render, which took a long time to realize their server configuration for deploying full stack react application was completely
different from front end app only.
Took me close to a week to figure out the problem and fixed it immediately.
